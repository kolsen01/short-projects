	<h1> Introduction </h1>
		<p> The product is a web application that renders a location map using client and server side data. Unforutnatley, the web application is riddled with security and privacy vulnerabilities. I am hired to resolve the security and privacy issues in the applications. For reference, the following is the link to the webb application we are testing: https://landmark-locator.herokuapp.com/ . </p> 
		<br>

	<h1> Methodology </h1>
	<p> The first step is to clean out any past documents in the collection (MongoDB database) for checkins. This allows for the following to be executed: </p> 
		<ul> <li> 
			1. Bypassing Restrictions on Input Choices
			2. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
			3. Privacy check
		</li> </ul>

	<h1> Abstract of findings </h1>
		<p> There were several issues found. First, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), privacy for location and obtaining all logins using a loophole in MongoDB (	-privacy issue: https://landmark-locator.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=kolsen ), hard code attacking using curl --> application errors instead of [] for no lat/lng and no login. Mongo injections </p>

	<h1> Issues found </h1>
		<p> technical analysis of issues found </p> 
		<br> 

		<ul> <li>
			1. Privacy
			2. XSS
			3. MongoDB Injections
		</li> </ul>
