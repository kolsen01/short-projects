#### Location is retrieved via JavaScript navigator.goelocation object, sent (latitude, longitude, login) to datastore, and displayed on the map with a unqiue marker. Local historic landmarks wihtin one mile of your location are retrieved and displayed on the map with a unique marker. Furthermore, location of other people can be sent and then displayed on map with a unique marker. Each marker includes an infobox that displays the person's created ID or name of landmark and distance (miles) away from you. When clicking on your marker, the closest landmark will be displayed with distance. Lastly, a polyline will be rendered connecting your current location to the closest historic landmark.
