### This repository is for the course COMP20 - Web Programming. It contains assigments and labs throughout the course that explore JavaScript, HTML, JQUERY, and more.

	1. My favorite assignment was the Portfolio. I have found it incredibly as I find myself referencing it for job applications and interviews. Also, it was a great introduction to HTML and CSS.

	2. Going into this course, I had no previous knowledge of Web Programming (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQUERY, and more) and had only taken one CS course at Tufts besides learning Python independently. Now, I can confidently use all these languages and I have a thorough knowledge of how the web works. 

	3. Personally, learning HTML and CSS has been extremely helpful. I find myself understanding different stylistic elements and contents of webpages. I also really enjoyed learning about security, specifically about XSS and privacy about geolocation. 

	4. I would love to delve deeper into security.
